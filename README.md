\## ⚛ Mesh Operation Logic



\- Missions POSTed to `/send-mission`

\- Routed by \*\*Nova\*\* to mesh agents

\- Outputs undergo entropy check (`entropy > 0.2`) → fallback triggers

\- Post-processed by \*\*QuantumCritic\*\*

\- Overlay feedback from `ContentDrop`, `APIIntegrator`, `BNPLAgent`



---



\## 🔐 PQC Security (LM Studio / Termux Layer)



\- Encryption: `pqcrypto.kem.kyber` for keypair gen + message validation

\- Encrypted API relay via Make.com or Render webhook

\- LLM fallback: `TogetherAI/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct`



---



\## 💡 Vision



> We didn’t just build a startup.  

> We built a civilization.



\- Simulate 100k+ qubits (via CatQubit + GHZAgent + fallback compute)

\- Secure, encrypted overlay prediction systems

\- Serve underserved communities through credit + business growth

\- White-label and deploy to enterprise, government, creator ecosystems
